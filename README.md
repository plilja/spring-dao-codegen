# Generate daos

 Work in progress

# TODO:s
* Nicer console output
* Command line interface
* Normalize config
* Evil Oracle dependency optional
* Test time stamps with time zones
* No unused imports should be generated
* Indentation generated column list
* Views
* Bulk insert

# Maybe later release
* SqlLite
* MariaDb
* Tables with composite id-columns
* Smart way to build and run all IT-tests
* Possibility to choose some formatting (for example lower case SQL vs upper case)
* Example projects (java8, java11)
* Customize lombok annotations?
* Kotlin support?
* More database patterns? (soft delete etc...)
* Merge into, would increase performance for inserts with natural key
